# Q-learning-Game
Q-learning is a values-based learning algorithm in reinforcement learning.

## Q-Learning — a simplistic overview (Game)
Let’s say that a robot has to cross a maze and reach the end point. There are mines, and the robot can only move one tile at a time. If the robot steps onto a mine, the robot is dead. The robot has to reach the end point in the shortest time possible.
